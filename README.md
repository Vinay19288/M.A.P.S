# M.A.P.S
Team -81 

M.A.P.S is all about a highly precise automated soldering system, which allows the user to solder micro-circuits as precisely as possible. The idea is to have an automated robotic arm that works on hand gestures as input providing flexibility of different levels of precisions. The user wears a glove and sends input signals using hand gestures. When a movement instruction is successfully received by the machine, haptic feedback is received from the gloves. The motivation behind the idea is the use of large robotic machines at a manufacturing level in the industrial world. This machine can be easily used on an individual level and the idea can be extended for some other precision-related activities.
